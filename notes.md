>### **Gibson v Manchester City Council**
>`Invitation to treat`   
>**Facts of the case:**   
	Mr. Gibson was the tenant of a house owned by Manchester City Council. The council wanted to give its tenants the opportunity to purchase the house they were renting so the council sent a letter to Mr. Gibson. Council said: We may be prepared to sell the house for �2180. The letter enclosed a formal application form. Mr. Gibson filled it in and sent it off. There were local elections, the new council doesn�t want to sell the house. Mr. Gibson argues: Hey, we have a contract!		              
**Question for the court:**   
 Whether the council�s letter to Mr. Gibson was a firm offer.             	       
**House of lords:**   
 No, the council�s letter was not an offer, it was only an invitation to treat.                
**Explanation:**   
 The letter was the council asking Mr. Gibson if he wanted to buy the house. If yes, fill in the application form. The application form was the offer. Mr. Gibson was the offeror.
